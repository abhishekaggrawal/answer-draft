What is on-topic or what is not is usually listed on [On-topic](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) page. The [Don't Ask](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) is also common on SE sites as it is not editable by community moderators. Although, it is possible if we make a good case why and then request.

From [this main meta](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259920/321725),

>Note that Stack Exchange developers / Community Managers / employees can also edit probably any other section of the site, if you make a good enough case on your per-site meta.

Regarding "what should I do?" questions being off-topic, it's clearly stated under the section "What questions are off topic here?"

>lack a clear goal we can address. We can provide solutions to achieve goals but we can not tell you what your goal should be. Questions should state the preferred outcome of the situation clearly.

Although, we know that it doesn't explicitly mention "what should I do" there, we might update it a little in this case.

Regarding "what does it mean", it falls into primarily opinion-based category. We agree that this one is not mentioned in the help center, so we have to address it as well.

So, in conclusion and to answer your final question, we will update the help center article to clearly specify that "what should I do" and "what does it mean" questions are off-topic, but you can ask questions about interpersonal interaction to achieve a goal.
